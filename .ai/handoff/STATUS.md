<!-- SECTION: summary -->
v0.2.0 production with auto-gateway-restart on failover. 179 vitest unit tests covering all exported utilities, register() handler logic (before_model_resolve, agent_end, message_sent), DST transition edge cases, status inspection (getFailoverStatus, clearModel, clearAllModels, formatDuration, formatStatus), atomic state file writes (atomicWriteFile utility used by both saveState and patchSessionModel), usage metrics (recordEvent, loadEvents, getMetricsSummary, resetMetrics, formatMetrics, formatEvents), and per-model cooldown history (getModelHistory, formatModelHistory with cooldown timeline, avg/max/total stats, failover relationship tracking). metrics.ts module provides append-only JSONL event logging with per-model/per-provider aggregation and detailed per-model cooldown history for capacity planning and model order optimization.

## Build Health

| Check | Result | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `npm test` | Pass (179 tests) | All utilities + handlers + DST transitions + status inspection + atomic writes + usage metrics + per-model cooldown history tested via vitest |
| `npm run build` | Pass | tsc --noEmit clean |

## Current State

- **Version:** 0.2.0
- **CI:** None configured
- **Production:** Active as OpenClaw plugin
- **v0.2 Roadmap:** COMPLETE - All tasks (T-001 through T-006) done

## Key Features (v0.2.0)

- Auto-gateway restart after failover switch (`restartOnSwitch`, `restartDelayMs`)
- Copilot-proxy cooldown error detection and failover triggering
- Immediate in-memory session override for instant model switching
- Temporary unavailability detection (cooldown, 503 service unavailable)
- `unavailableCooldownMinutes` config (default 15min vs 300min for rate limits)
- Provider-wide blocking logic
- Debug logging mode with sample rate
- Supports 40+ LLM failover: Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, GitHub Copilot, Perplexity
- DST-aware midnight PT calculation (tries both UTC-7 and UTC-8 offsets)
- **Status inspection CLI** (`npx tsx status.ts`) with pretty-print, JSON, and clear commands
- **Atomic state writes** - temp-file + rename prevents corruption on crash
- **Usage metrics** - append-only JSONL event log with per-model/per-provider aggregation, CLI (`npx tsx metrics.ts`), and programmatic API
- **Per-model cooldown history** - `getModelHistory()` with cooldown timeline, avg/max/total stats, failover relationship tracking, CLI (`npx tsx metrics.ts history <model>`)

## v0.2 Roadmap - Complete

| Feature | Status | GitHub Issue | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|-------------|

| ~~DST bug~~ | DONE | [#2](https://github.com/elvatis/openclaw-model-failover/issues/2) | getNextMidnightPT now tries both offsets, verified with DST transition tests |
| ~~Status inspection~~ | DONE | [#3](https://github.com/elvatis/openclaw-model-failover/issues/3) | status.ts with CLI + programmatic API, 21 tests |
| ~~Atomic writes~~ | DONE | [#4](https://github.com/elvatis/openclaw-model-failover/issues/4) | atomicWriteFile() utility used by saveState() and patchSessionModel() for crash-safe writes |
| ~~Usage metrics~~ | DONE | [#5](https://github.com/elvatis/openclaw-model-failover/issues/5) | metrics.ts with JSONL event log, aggregation, CLI, 28 tests |

- **(Verified)**: confirmed by running code/tests
- **(Assumed)**: derived from docs/config, not directly tested
- **(Unknown)**: needs verification
