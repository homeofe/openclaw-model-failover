## 2026-02-27 T-003: Fix DST bug in getNextMidnightPT

**Agent:** claude-opus-4-6
**Phase:** implementing
**Commit:** pending

### What was done

- Rewrote `getNextMidnightPT()` to try both possible PT offsets (UTC-7 PDT, UTC-8 PST) and verify which one produces midnight when formatted via Intl.DateTimeFormat
- Old approach: used current offset to derive tomorrow's midnight - wrong when DST transition occurs between now and tomorrow
- New approach: exhaustive check of both offsets, picking the one that verifies as midnight in PT
- Added 8 new tests covering all DST edge cases:
  - Normal PST day, normal PDT day
  - Spring forward: before transition, on transition day (bug case), after transition
  - Fall back: night before, on transition day (bug case), after transition
- Total tests: 81 (up from 73)
- Updated STATUS.md, TRUST.md, MANIFEST.json

### Decisions made

- Chose "try both offsets" approach over "guess and correct" because it's simpler, more readable, and exhaustive for America/Los_Angeles
- Hardcoding offsets 7 and 8 is acceptable since the function is specifically for PT
- Testing with vi.useFakeTimers() + vi.setSystemTime() to simulate exact DST transition moments

## 2026-02-27 v0.2 Roadmap Definition

**Agent:** claude-opus-4-6
**Phase:** planning
**Commit:** fe36602 + roadmap commit (TBD)

### What was done

- Committed uncommitted v0.1.6 changes (auto-gateway-restart feature: restartOnSwitch, restartDelayMs)
- Created GitHub labels: high-priority, medium-priority, low-priority
- Created 5 GitHub issues for v0.2 roadmap:
  - #1: Export internal functions and add proper unit tests (HIGH)
  - #2: Fix hardcoded PST offset in getNextMidnightPT - DST bug (HIGH)
  - #3: Add failover status inspection command (MEDIUM)
  - #4: Add atomic state file writes to prevent corruption (MEDIUM)
  - #5: Add per-model and per-provider usage metrics (LOW)
- Updated DASHBOARD.md with v0.2 issue tracker and suggested implementation order
- Updated STATUS.md to reflect roadmap is now defined
- Updated NEXT_ACTIONS.md with issue-linked tasks
- Pushed v0.1.6 commit to origin/main

### Decisions made

- Chose to focus on testability (#1) and correctness (#2) as high-priority over new features
- DST bug classified as high-priority because it affects 8 months/year
- Metrics (#5) kept low-priority since it is a nice-to-have, not a correctness issue
- Recommended doing #1 and #2 together since tests should cover the DST fix
